As a **Student Tutor** at the Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT), I supported junior students between 2019 and 2022 in multiple areas of cybersecurity and computing, including:

- Artificial Intelligence (AI) and algorithms  
- Software engineering principles  
- Cryptography and secure communications  
- Computer networking  

Beyond technical tutoring, I also **guided peers in research proposals and final year projects** on cybersecurity and applied machine learning.  
This experience significantly improved students’ academic performance and research output.
