This review explores **AI and ML-driven cybersecurity models** for autonomous vehicles,  
with emphasis on anomaly detection, adversarial robustness, and edge-computing-based defense systems.  

A **conceptual framework** is proposed to enable **real-time mitigation of cyberattacks** in connected and autonomous transport systems.
