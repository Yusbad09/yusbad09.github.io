This work presents a **digital twin-driven framework** for autonomous transportation, enabling  
- **real-time decision-making**,  
- **predictive maintenance**, and  
- **traffic optimization**.  

The framework leverages simulation and AI integration to improve reliability and resilience in next-generation transport systems.
