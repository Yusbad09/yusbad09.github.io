This study presents a federated deep learning cybersecurity framework for decentralized IoT systems, integrating CNN and LSTM models with differential privacy and homomorphic encryption to ensure secure, real-time threat detection. The system achieved 96.2% accuracy and low latency (31.6 ms), while significantly reducing privacy leakage to 7.4% under membership inference attacks. Its adaptive defense mechanism improved detection of zero-day attacks from 85.1% to 91.8% after five update cycles, demonstrating strong resilience and privacy-preserving capabilities.
Abstract

cyber security system to identify and respond to cyber attacks in distributed IoT 
settings without compromising data privacy. The suggested model combines 
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) 
networks in a federated learning framework, aided by differential privacy and 
homomorphic encryption for secure online model training on the edge devices. The 
system was tested and evaluated with a live network trace-based IoT testbed as well 
as publicly available datasets (TON_IoT and IoT-23). Experimental results show the 
model detected 96.2% accuracy, 31.6 milliseconds average latency, and privacy leakage 
was minimized to 7.4% under membership inference attacks. The adaptive defence 
mechanism allowed the model to effectively counter novel, zero-day attacks with its 
detection capability improved from 85.1% to 91.8% upon five rounds of updating. These 
results prove the feasibility and effectiveness of federated AI architectures for real
time, privacy-enhancing cybersecurity in decentralized IoT systems.
