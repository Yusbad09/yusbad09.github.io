As a **Student Tutor** at the Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT), I supported junior students between 2019 and 2022 in multiple areas of cybersecurity and computing, including:

- Artificial Intelligence (AI) and algorithms  
- Software engineering principles  
- Cryptography and secure communications  
- Computer networking  

I also **guided peers on research proposals and final year projects** in cybersecurity and applied machine learning.  
This mentoring helped improve students’ academic performance and strengthened research output.
