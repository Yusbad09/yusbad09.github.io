I facilitated **SOC and Cloud Security training** sessions at Huawei Technologies, 
covering:

- Security Operations workflow & SIEM tools  
- Cloud infrastructure hardening  
- Incident detection & response strategies  
- Threat intelligence integration  

This program trained junior analysts and engineers to adopt best practices in cloud 
security and SOC operations.
